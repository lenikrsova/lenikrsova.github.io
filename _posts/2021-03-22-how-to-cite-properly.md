In academia, citations are no joke. Either you have them in order, or you fail. At least, that's  one of the most perpetuating myths about citing sources in academia. There are tons of myths like this one, which makes it unnecessarily difficult for students to chill about the way they cite, and just do it. With some handy tools and basic rules, citations are not as terrifying as it sometimes look, and can be done by anyone.

The basic premise of citing sources in academic writing of any sort is to give the credit where it's due to the smart people whose work inspired you to write yours. It also prevents people from presenting other people's work as their own, which is an act of plagiarism and violation of academic intergrity. In non-academic word, you stole someone idea and didn't give them credit.  Boo! So everyone can realize where and when you cite in your own writing, there are citations styles and rules unifying how to do it.

### Citation styles 
In the North American academic environment, the most commonly used citations styles are MLA, APA, and Chicago.

### Citations tools to make your life easier
Academics use some sort of tools helping them manage all their references. Usually, you run into Zotero, Mendeley, RefWorks, EndNote and others. It is a question of preferences. I personally quite recently switched to PaperPile based on a recommendation by one of my friends. 

If you don't need to use a reference management tool, there are free and accesible options, too.

#### Google Scholar (+ browser extension)
One of them is Google Scholar, the alpha and omega of searching online for academic articles developed by Google. Not only it is a database of academic works, books, articles and other sources, but it's features include cited by, citing option, version control, tagging etc.

### A couple words before we part
A mix-matched APA and Chicago reference system should not be treated as a death penalty type of crime. A gentle reminder to make sure the student doesn't forget in the future is way more effective. Unfortunately, some professors use any mistakes in the refernce system of an essay as a tool how to exercise their powers over students. However, it is also true that correctly cited sources save everyone's beautiful butts from serious accusations of plagiarism and other type of intelectuall property theft. 

True, some professors use citations or the lack of them as a tool how to exercise their powers over students. Substantially downgrading a student's grades because they
