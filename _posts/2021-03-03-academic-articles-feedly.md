Us, researchers, live off of academic articles. Keeping up with the neverending flow of new research is a discipline of its own, so it's always nice when someone makes it easier for you. For the very reason, I am sharing with you my Feedly feed (no pun intended!) of academic journals I read.

The ones included are the core of my own intelectual space. I use them to keep myself updated on what is going on within the research communities I am or wish to be part of.

So far, you'll find links to:
- Big Data & Society
- Computers in Human Behavior
- European Journal of Communication
- First Monday
- Information, Communication & Society
- Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication
- Journal of Digital Social Research

- The Journal of Pop Culture
