As many people did during the ongoing pandemic, I also returned to the video games. However, my rediscovered passion, I dropped out of when I was a teenager, comes with a bit of a plot twist. Playing video games and being an information science researcher interested in researching algorithms, user experience, and pop culture writ-large, inspired me to start documenting my thoughts and ideas about video video games.

In this post, I want to look at the case of one of the early secondary quests of **<a href="https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3" target="_blank">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>**, called **Wandering in The Dark**. I was so frustrated with this quest I had to write it out of my system. I love the environment design and immersive experience of this level, but I equally hated the frequency of facing difficult enemies so early on in the game without any sort of preparation or warning. This resulted in something I never liked doing even when I was an active gamer - I had to find support online in the forums and by watching a walkthrough. 

You'll soon realize, this post is also a rather cathartic way of writing myself out of the mild "trauma" induced by this quest. Like, I DID NOT expect to have my pixels kicked so many times so early and in such a brutal way... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** is probably not the easiest way how to get back on the proverbial horse of playing games but it was my first choice for many reasons. I am Czech, and Slavic folklore, which The Witcher draws from and encompasses so well, is what I've lived surrounded by since I was a little kid. I've read the first couple of Sapkowski's books, I watched the original [Polish TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hexer_(TV_series) long before Netflix introduced Geralt's white hair, coarse voice and "I don't really care" attitude to the masses in its [TV show released in 2019](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5180504).

Witcher's world is as much part of my upbringing and culture as it was for the Polish. It is also one of the most praised video games in the industry offering all the aspects I like about video games: immersive experience; shenaningans of an RPG open world; storytelling on the scale of a feature movie; and multiple scenarios and endings based on the choices players make throughout the game (ok, I might have accidentally killed Keira, so what?).

This being said, The Witcher 3 can be also a rather difficult game if you, like me, are a noob. For instance, I had to figure out my way around PlayStation controller. I didn't have any experience with playing the previous titles in the series which posed additional problems  for me regarding controls, fighting, potion making, etc. However, the learning curve also made the game immensely enjyoable, at least once I was able to get the hang of it.
