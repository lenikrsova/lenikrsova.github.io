Learning about UX/UI without actually designing a prototype is like learning to swim without stepping into water. Thankfully, there's tons of tools accesible and kind to beginners and to-be UX/UI designers. One of them is Adobe XD, which I've been using lately to learn basics of designing, prototyping and testing low-fidelity to high-fidelity prototypes of (mostly) game-related designs.

Recently, I run into a YouTube tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAbq1eKey19tt-FfaIO1RMA">Dansky</a> in which he explains step-by-step how to make a basic introductory game interface selecting a character to play as.

So, without further ado, if you want to try my very very basic prototype, here it is. Use X, O, and arrow keys (left and right) accordingly to navigate through the prototype. It's not much but it's an honest work and first attempts to tame the beast of game UI design. Have fun!
