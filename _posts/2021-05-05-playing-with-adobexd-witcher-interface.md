Learning about UX/UI without actually designing a prototype is like learning to swim without stepping into water. Thankfully, there's tons of tools accesible and kind to beginners and to-be UX/UI designers. One of them is Adobe XD, which I've been using lately to learn basics of designing, prototyping and testing low-fidelity to high-fidelity prototypes of (mostly) game-related designs.

Recently, I run into a YouTube tutorial by Dansky in which he explains step-by-step how to make a basic introductory game interface selecting a character to play as.

## How I ended up doing this
A long time ago, I was invested quite heavily in designing websites and to some extent also programming them. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't keep up with constant changes of design trends and upgraded markdown and programming languages. I dropped it and quite honeslty never got back to it.

Currently, I am way more interested in designing tools or applications that bring people fun, joy, and experience that is seamless yet transparent. I've been reading a lot baou dakr patterns in design, which usually webcommerce and more often also games use to trick their customers to buy more, play more, or just spend more time on their platform. If this sounds familiar to you, you might remember that design of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram are based on these principles. 

So, being discouraged by websites and disappointed by social media platforms, I jumped to explore the venue of video games.

So, without further ado, if you want to try my very very basic prototype, here it is. Use X, O, and arrow keys (left and right) accordingly to navigate through the prototype. It's not much but it's an honest work and first attempts to tame the beast of game UI design. Have fun!
