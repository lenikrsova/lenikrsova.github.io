Hi! My name is Leni and I'm the one running this website. I am a PhD student at iSchool in Syracuse (NY) which makes me a researcher. I am interested in algorithms, data, user experience and pop culture writ-large. I started this blog to dump here my ideas, thoughts and things I've noticed about pop culture, game design and related topics.

I started playing video games when I was five and stopped as a teenager when Mass Effect came out. Those included first-person shooters like DOOM, Quake, Heretic, Duke Nukem 3D; strategy games like Side Meier's Colonization and Cvilization, Age of Empires, Ceaser III, Tycoons; and adventure games including Czech Polda, Veil of Darkness and others. I returned to video games in 2020 through Call of Duty: Mobile, Life is Strange and hidden objects & mini-puzzles Lost Lands game series. 

My favorite games are ones which put the gamer in the center of their design by creating an immersive experience with their rich narrative and thoughtful designed experience. I am currently working on my way through **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** and its expansions. I am also a huge fan of indie games and applaud all the game developers putting their work out there. 

Occasionally, I am a game tester and localization translator for games and software.
