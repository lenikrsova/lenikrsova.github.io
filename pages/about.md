Hi! My name is Leni and I'm the one running this website. I am a PhD student at iSchool in Syracuse (NY) which makes me a researcher in training. I am interested in algorithms, datafication, user experience and pop culture writ-large. I started this blog to share my ideas, thoughts and things I've noticed about topics, ideas and thoughts related to my research.

### Algorithms & Datafication

I used to work in companies handling personal data harvested from social media platforms. At some point I wasn't okay with the unethical dimensions of this type of work and joined the other (Light) side of research. I moved both physically and mentally from Europe to USA to follow a path that allows me to ask and work on pressing questions like "Are people aware of their personal data being harvested and used so heavily? What can we do about it? Does anyone even care? How can we make people care? And how can we make companies be more transparent?" and so on.

From the topics of datafication and data surveillance, I extended my interest to algorithms and how these help design the experience for thousands of people using their personal data. Currently, I am interested in learning more about the intersection of recommmendation algorithms, datafication, data literacy and pop culture. To be more specific, Netflix and alike is one of the socio-technical platforms I am interested in, especially in relation to their users and what they make out of the algorithmic recommendations and related phenomena.

A current study I prepare to work on with Dr. Brian McKernan will concern about folk theories evolving around and explaining Netflix recommender algorithm.

### Video games
I am interested in user experience (UX) and design of video games as an experience that helps us escape from our mundane worlds. I just recently started researching this domain.

My favorite games are ones which put the gamer in the center of their design by **creating an immersive experience with their rich narrative and thoughtful designed experience**. I am currently working on my way through *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* and its expansions. I am also a huge fan of indie games (yay, Stardew Valley!) and applaud all the game developers for putting their work out there just because they love developing games. 

I started playing video games when I was 5 and stopped as a teenager around the time the first *Mass Effect* came out. I played games including first-person shooters like *DOOM*, *Quake*, *Heretic*, *Duke Nukem 3D*; strategy games like *Sid Meier's Colonization* and *Cvilization*, *Age of Empires*, *Caeser III*, *Tycoons*; RPG games like *Mafia*, *Diablo II*; and adventure games including Czech *Polda*, *Veil of Darkness* and others. I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through *Call of Duty Mobile*, *Life is Strange* and hidden objects & mini-puzzles *Lost Lands* game series. 

### Non-academic fun

When my PhD obligations permits, I am a game tester and localization translator for games and software. I am also learning the ropes of game design with Unity. I really enjoy environment design, and can spend endless hours creating pastures, mountains, and other types of landscape (usually with pre-made assets). 

If you want to connect with me, you can find me on Steam as leeloo.

I am a member of the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) and hang out on Discord with people from <a href="https://grux.org/#1">IGDA Games Research & User Experience Special Interest Group</a> and <a href="https://www.designbuddies.community/">Design Buddies</a>.

In "offline" world far from computer screens and my PhD, I enjoy water coloring, travelling, yoga, and playing basketball against my basketball proficient partner Cole.
