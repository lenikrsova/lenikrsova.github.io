Hi! My name is Leni and I'm the one running this website. I am a PhD student at iSchool in Syracuse (NY) which makes me a researcher in training. I am interested in algorithms, datafication, user experience and pop culture writ-large. I started this blog to share here my ideas, thoughts and things I've noticed about pop culture, game design and topics related to my research.

### Video games
My favorite games are ones which put the gamer in the center of their design by **creating an immersive experience with their rich narrative and thoughtful designed experience**. I am currently working on my way through *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* and its expansions. I am also a huge fan of indie games and applaud all the game developers putting their work out there just because they love developing games. 

I started playing video games when I was five and stopped as a teenager when Mass Effect came out. Those included first-person shooters like DOOM, Quake, Heretic, Duke Nukem 3D; strategy games like Side Meier's Colonization and Cvilization, Age of Empires, Ceaser III, Tycoons; and adventure games including Czech Polda, Veil of Darkness and others. I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through Call of Duty Mobile, Life is Strange and hidden objects & mini-puzzles Lost Lands game series. 

When my PhD obligations permits, I am a game tester and localization translator for games and software.

### Algorithms & Datafication

I used to work in companies handling personal data harvested from social media platforms. At some point I wasn't okay with the unethical dimensions of this type of work and joined the other (Light) side of research. I moved both physically and mentally from Europe to USA to follow the path that allows me to ask and work on questions like "Are people aware of their personal data being used so heavily? What can we do about it? Does anyone even care?" and so on.

From the topics of datafication and data surveillance, I hopped on the bandwagon of algorithms and how these design experience of thousands of people using personal data. Currently, I am interested in learning more about the intersection of recommmendation algorithms, datafication, data literacy and pop culture. To be more specific, Netflix and alike is one of the platforms I am interested to look at in relation to its users and what they make out of the algorithmic recommendations.

A current study I prepare to work on with Dr. Brian McKernan will concern about folk theories encompassing Netflix algorithm.
