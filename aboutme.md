## Research-wise

### Algorithms & Datafication

**I used to work in companies handling personal data harvested from social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.** At some point I wasn’t okay with the unethical dimensions of this type of work and joined the other (Light) side of research. I moved both physically and mentally from Europe to USA to follow a path that allows me to ask and work on pressing questions like “Are people aware of their personal data being harvested and used so heavily? What can we do about it? Does anyone even care? How can we make people care? And how can we make companies be more transparent?” and so on.

From the topics of datafication and data surveillance, **I extended my interest to algorithms and how these help (or not) design the experience for thousands of people**. Currently, I am interested in learning more about the **intersection of recommmendation algorithms, datafication, data literacy and pop culture**. To be more specific, Netflix and alike are one of the socio-technical platforms I am interested in studying in detail. Especially intruiging is **what users make out of the algorithmic recommendations and related phenomena, and how they resist to what algorithms expect them to do**.

A current study I prepare to work on will concern about **folk theories evolving around and explaining Netflix recommender algorithm**.

### Video games & UX/Design Research

I am interested in user experience (UX) and design of video games as an experience that helps us escape from our mundane worlds and deal with unprecedented situations. Currently, I am learning about video games as helpful coping tools in pandemic.

My favorite games are the ones which put gamers in the center of the design by creating an immersive experience using narrative and thoughtfully designed experience. I am currently working on my way through The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its expansions. I am also a huge fan of indie games (yay, Stardew Valley!) and applaud all the game developers for putting their work out there just because they love developing games.

I started playing video games when I was 5 and stopped as a teenager around the time the first Mass Effect came out. I used to play games including first-person shooters like DOOM, Quake, Heretic, Duke Nukem 3D; strategy games like Sid Meier’s Colonization and Civilization, Age of Empires, Caesar III, Tycoons; RPG games like Mafia, Diablo II; and adventure games including Czech Polda, Veil of Darkness, and others. I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through Call of Duty Mobile, Life is Strange and hidden objects & mini-puzzles Lost Lands game series.

I am a member of the <a href="https://igda.org/">IGDA (International Game Developers Association)</a> and I hang out on Discord with people from <a href="https://grux.org/">IGDA Games Research & User Experience Special Interest Group</a> and <a href="https://www.designbuddies.community/">Design Buddies</a>. I am a proud patreon of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/noclip">NoClip productions</a> and you should become a one too.

## Outside of Academia

### Game testing & development

When my PhD obligations permits, I am a game tester and localization translator for games and software. I am also learning the ropes of game design with Unity. I really enjoy environment design, and can spend endless hours creating pastures, mountains, and other types of landscape (usually with pre-made assets).

I currently work on a semi-serious 2D video game about perils of immigration with my friend Albi.

### "I'm a bit of a painter myself."
In “offline” world far from computer screens and my PhD, I enjoy water coloring, traveling, cooking, reading, yoga, movies, and playing basketball with my basketball proficient partner Cole.
